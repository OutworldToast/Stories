Intro
really like this part

Ch 1
    pg 3, somewhere middle: find synonym for "short wall", it doesn't work with "nearby", or perhaps just remove "nearby"
Ch 2
    (?) pg 11, par 3: "zoned out" to "zoned-out" for clarity
I love the small interjections of metaphors
    (?????) pg 15, par 2 after blank line: "scalds" should be "scolds"
    (??) pg 15, par 1 after second blank line: remove "restarting"
    (?) pg 17, par 5: "she comes out with" doesn't work, perhaps "starts"
    pg 18, next par: laughed at the last sentence
love the difference between direct speech and narration: former is 'normal', while latter is quite fancy. gives the impression the narrator is a well educated person, or perhaps some divine creature
    (?) pg 19, par 4: "enough has been enough" to "enough is enough", you're writing in present after all
lmao Evan is such a simp

Ch 3
	(?) pg 20, par 8: "an incredible sense of urgency dripping from her words" to "radiating an incredible sense of urgency"
wait that was intentional, what Darashan did? lmao
fuck, I imagined it to be her right hand
UNCLE?????
	pg 25, par 6 from bottom:	remove everything after direct speech, and merge with next paragraph
	pg 25, par 4 from bottom:	this reminiscing is enough
